/**
 * TODO:
 * First of all, refactor all rules so they look like this?
 * abc-def-xyz.rule.ts
 * The class name is PascalCase
 * 
 * TODO:
 * Ok so the idea:...
 * Verify that an element, after enough navigations, contains X tests.
 * If it doesn't, then build the messaage so that it shows what it contains.
 * Hopefully a small text, and if it's too long, then I should make an excerpt,
 * and then have the user check the polling logs (or UI in the future.)
 * 
 * Mostly implemented hehe.
 * Create unit tests, and implement message shortening.
